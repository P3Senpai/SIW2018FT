# SIW2018FT
This program is the Falcon Tech prototype for the Social Innovation Week. We are collaborating with Michal Zwinger and Marek Lisy. Our app will address the problem of over debtedness in the Czech Republic. Our core features include having a contract scanner that will be checked by NGOs focusing on helping people with finacial questions. A breif info course (video and audio) that will educate the users on contracts and how to avoid getting trapped in debt. Our app will also include the users data present in a visual way (probably through some sort of graphs).
